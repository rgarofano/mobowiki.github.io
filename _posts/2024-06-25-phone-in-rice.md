title: "Don't Put Your Phone In Rice"
categories: posts
---

Anyone who has ever dealt with a wet phone has likely heard the advice "put it in a bag of rice". The idea is that rice will absorb all the water that has entered the phone over a day or two and then you can safely power it on and use it as if nothing happened. This couldn't be further from the truth! If water reaches the inside of your phone and comes into contact with the motherboard it will **instantly** create corrosion in that area. Putting the phone in rice is not going to reverse this damage and in some cases it can actually make things worse. If the board has been damaged, powering on the device after removing it from the bag of rice can increase the severity of the damage. At this point you may be wondering why so many people have told you that putting their device in rice has worked for them. This is simply because most mobile devices these days are made with waterproofing in mind. These rice success stories can be summarized as cases where water did not actually reach the main board and as such no treatment was required.

Hopefully I have convinced you that putting a phone in rice is pointless, but what should you do instead? Opening up the phone is the best initial course of action. If you aren't comfortable with this, get the phone to a professional ASAP. After the main board has been removed from the phone, it's best to scrub or soak it in isopropyl alcohol to displace the water. If you bring it to a professional technician, they may have an ultrasonic cleaner on-site which is the best thing for the job.
