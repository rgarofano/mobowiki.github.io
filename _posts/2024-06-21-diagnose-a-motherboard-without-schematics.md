title: "How to Diagnose a Motherboard Without Schematics"
categories: posts

Schematics are an immensely helpful resource when trying to find one or more faulty components on a motherboard. Unfortunately, schematics are not publicly available for many boards. This means that if you want to get good at fixing motherboards, doing so without the use of schematics is an essential skill. This page is my attempt at a comprehensive guide for doing just that. For the moment, this is a work in progress which I will be updating periodically.

Before we dive into the set of steps, I want to preface this by saying that diagnosing a motherboard takes time and patience. It's important that before you begin this process, you are certain that there is a fault on the motherboard. In this guide, we will be focused on a typical no power situation. This means no fan spin or any other sign of life when pressing the power button even while being connected to a known-good power supply. For laptops, it's a good idea to check the charger and rule that out right away. Additionally, I would reccomend disconnecting the battery, trackpad, RAM, etc. one at a time and checking if the device turns on. I gaurantee if you work with enough machines, one day you'll come across a no power issue due to a faulty RAM stick, battery, or trackpad!

Ok, you've ruled out all other possibilities and now it's time to take a closer look at the motherboard and hopefully fix the issue. The following is my general set of steps for finding the fault(s) without schematics.

### Step One: Spot the Obvious

Always start with a [visual inspection](visual-inspection.html) of the board. This can save you time by identifying obvious issues which narrows down the problem space. In some cases you may find that the damage is too extensive for a repair to be economical. As you gain more experience, you'll get faster at inspecting the board and be able to identify key issues very early in the troubleshooting process.

### Step Two: Go with the Flow
