# How to Diagnose a Motherboard Without Schematics

Schematics are an immensely helpful resource when trying to find one or more faulty components on a motherboard. Unfortunately, schematics are not publicly available for many boards. This means that if you want to get good at fixing motherboards, doing so without the use of schematics is an essential skill. This page is my attempt at a comprehensive guide for doing just that. For the moment, this is a work in progress which I will be updating periodically.

### Step One

Always start with a [visual inspection](2024-06-21-visual-inspection.md) of the board. This can save you time by identifying obvious issues which narrows down the problem space. In some cases you may find that the damage is too extensive for a repair to be economical. As you gain more experience, you'll get faster at inspecting the board and be able to identify key issues very early in the troubleshooting process.
