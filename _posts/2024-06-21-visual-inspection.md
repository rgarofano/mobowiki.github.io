The visual inspection is a critical step in any motherboard repair. It could be the difference between a few minutes and a few hours spent troubleshooting. To be clear, we are talking about a quick scan of all the components on the board at the beginning of a repair. There's no need to perform any measurements during a visual inspection, take a quick glance at each component and make note of any signs of damage. For many repairs, signs of damage - which I will provide some examples of below - can be difficult or impossible to see without a [microscope](/misc/2024/06/22/recommended-tools.html). There may be some cheaper alternatives to a microscope that are "good enough" for some jobs but if you're serious about performing microsoldering repairs then a high quality, sturdy microscope is one of the best tools for the job.
