title: "Visual Inspection"

The visual inspection is a critical step in any motherboard repair. It could be the difference between a few minutes and a few hours spent troubleshooting. To be clear, we are talking about a quick scan of all the components on the board at the beginning of a repair. There's no need to perform any measurements during a visual inspection, take a quick glance at each component and make note of any signs of damage. For many repairs, signs of damage - which I will provide some examples of below - can be difficult or impossible to see without a [microscope](/misc/2024/06/22/recommended-tools.html). There may be some cheaper alternatives to a microscope that are "good enough" for some jobs but if you're serious about performing these kinds of repairs then a high quality, sturdy microscope is one of the best tools for the job.

## Blown Out Components

</div>

If you see a cracked, burnt, and or discoloured component on the board (including but not limited to the images above) it means that component may be causing a short circuit. You can use a [multimeter](/misc/2024/06/22/recommended-tools.html) to confirm a component is shorted.

## Liquid Damage

It's also common to come across liquid damage (see image above). Liquid damage is typically a difficult repair. Unfortunately, many users are misinformed on the [best practice for a device that has liquid spilled on it](/posts/2024/06/25/phone-in-rice.html). This can lead to nasty looking motherboards that we have the pleasure to fix, lucky us! The only thing you can really do in this situation is give the board a deep clean with isopropyl alcohol and replace any components that have been damaged. I will leave it up to your discretion as to what you deem a no fix in these liquid damage situations. One thing to keep in mind is that data recovery is often easier then trying to completely fix a liquid damage board.
