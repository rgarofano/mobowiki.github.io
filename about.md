Hi there, my name is Ryan Garofano - creator of the Mobo Wiki. I am an engineering student with a passion for technology and learning. I worked as a computer technician for four years while going through school, learning the basics of computer software and hardware repair. I have a strong foundation in software engineering, working for companies such as HP and Arista Networks through internships.<br/><br/>
I started this page because I have been wanting to learn how to fix motherboards at a component-level ever since I started studying engineering. It's proven to be one of my most challenging endeavours as the resources available online are not as plentiful compared to software development. In fact, I have found many times throughout my studies that the amount of high quality resources available for more advanced engineering topics can be few and far between. My goal is to make this page a one stop shop for learning how to repair a motherboard in order to make it easier for the next generation of technicians/engineers to learn. If that sounds good to you then welcome, I hope you find this to be a helpful resource.

Cheers,<br/>
Ryan
